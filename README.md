GetElected!
==========

GetElected! is a browser incremental game. You interact with the browser to build resources to either purchase power ups, or to complete goals which will unlock more power ups.

This game was inspired by [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and [Clicking Bad](http://clickingbad.nullism.com/). Both of these are FANTASTIC games!

This game is in early Alpha right now, so to be completely and unabashedly honest, it's ugly.

I know. Sorry. I've been a firm believer of function over form.
