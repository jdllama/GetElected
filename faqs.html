<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p class="question">What the hell is this game?</p>
<p class="answer">This is GetElected!&copy; by J.D. Lowe, an Incremental Game where you build your resources and spend them wisely to move forward in the game.</p>
<p class="question">How do I play?</p>
<p class="answer">You use your mouse to build up resources to meet the "Current Goal" requirement listed for each resource. Once it has met that goal, you can click the goal itself in the bottom left corner to move forward with the game.</p>
<p class="question">Do I have to click the goal each time?</p>
<p class="answer">Nope! You can go to Settings and choose to Auto Purchase the goal.</p>
<p class="question">How do power ups work?</p>
<p class="answer">You can purchase "Primary" power ups, which will increment your resource at a set rate. You can also purchase "Secondary" power ups which will strengthen the Primary power ups. Lastly, you can purchase "Tertiary" power ups, which will make individual Player-Created Resource (aka clicking on Effort) stronger.</p>
<p class="question">I can't purchase *insert power up*</p>
<p class="answer">Please make sure you have all of the resources needed. If it's asking for a resource that you don't have yet, then focus on clearing goals, and you will unlock further resources.</p>
<p class="question">This game looks ugly!</p>
<p class="answer">VERY true. This game is currently in very early Alpha; as such, the functionality is there, but the layout is admittedly atrocious. I am working on making it better, I swear!</p>
<p class="question">I found a bug!</p>
<p class="answer">First, be sure to refresh the page. Secondly, please reach out to me either on <a href="https://twitter.com/GetElectedGame/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getelectedgame" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, or on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/jdllama" target="_blank">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p class="question">I want to help program/design this!</p>
<p class="answer">I appreciate the thought, I honestly and truly do. However, this is something I am working on on my own; I will be reaching out to people that I need help with. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jdllama/GetElected" target="_blank">Github</a> for your perusal!</p>
<p class="question">Why is this game so addicting?</p>
<p class="answer">There's something almost visceral about watching numbers climb up, starting slow and going fast.</p>
